% calcuateR2 Cacluate R-squared
% R2 = calcuateR2(z,z_est) takes two inputs - The observed data z and its
% estimation z_est (may be from a regression or other model), and then
% compute the R-squared value a measure of goodness of fit. R2 = 0
% corresponds to the worst fit, whereas R2 = 1 corresponds to the best fit.
