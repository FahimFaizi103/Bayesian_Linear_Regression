  - or Use Metropolis-Hastings MCMC with uniform proposal. 
 Both methods are provided in Main.m, comment out appropriately.  
Use analysis_Bayesian_Regression to visualize the results of simulation. 
 - You can visualize the trace-plot of linear regression coefficients, histograms, autocorrelation functions and R^2 test scores.
